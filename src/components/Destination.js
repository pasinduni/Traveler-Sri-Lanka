                    <p>One of Sri Lanka's whale-watching hotspots, Mirissa is a beautiful strip of beach with bendy palms and roaring surf.

Closer to shore look out for turtles that stick their heads out to breathe. Mirissa is a small town on the south coast of Sri Lanka, located in the Matara District of the Southern Province. It's beach and nightlife make it a popular tourist destination. It is also a fishing port and one of the island's main whale and dolphin watching locations.</p>

                    <h2>Sigiriya</h2>
                    <p>Surrounded by thick forests the mammoth rocky outcrop of Sigiriya is an enchanting sight. Tighten those shoelaces and pump up your adrenalin as you climb to the flat-topped summit to explore the ruins of an ancient kingdom. But the magic of Sigiriya lies in viewing it from a distance and for a spellbinding view from afar, climb up Pidurangala which lies one kilometre to the north.</p>

                    <p>A few places in the world are as bewitching as the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Galle.
